# BlackJack
A fun little project I decided to code. The game is scripted so that the dealer plays by predefined rules defined in-game.
It was a nice opportunity for me to learn how to use basic c# functionality and some more advanced Windows Forms features.
You can run the game using the .exe or by opening BlackJack.sln in your desired IDE. Enjoy!
